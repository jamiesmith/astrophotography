# Automation

These scripts are meant to be used with TheSkyX professional, and most are based on the scripts from the [ScriptTheSkyX Documentation and Examples](http://www.bisque.com/sc/media/p/44090.aspx) but for my own setup.

Motivation from Richard S. Wright

As there was no license specified in the files, hopefully it's OK to store my version of the couple that I changed out here.
